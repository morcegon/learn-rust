# #100DaysOfCode Learning Rust

## Day 1

Learned how to install Rust at my machine, actually is pretty simple.
After that, I started a new project using Cargo, the Rust dependency/project manager, very similar to Composer for PHP. Then I started to actually "code". First I have used the `println!` function, which prints out whatever yout need, then I saw variables and primitive types.
